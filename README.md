Stump-A-Trump: CLI
=====
Interactive CLI for a guessing game that challenges you to determine which tweets are from President Elect Donald J. Trump and which are from parody accounts.

Part of the client-server game project for [CENG 356](http://www.ece.uvic.ca/~ceng356/) at UVic.

### Installation
**No service interaction at this point. Game is mocked!**

Make sure the `stumpatrump_service` is running (repo TBD).

Install the node version in [.nvmrc](.nvmrc). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to automatically load the correct node version. It's cool and good.
```shell
git clone git@github.com:trstephen/stumpatrump_cli.git

cd stumpatrump_cli

# if nvm installed
nvm use

npm install

node client.js
```
